## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this actually make money?**
A: Yes. Long-tail keywords (like "AI tools for dentists") have low competition and high intent. At 10k views/month, you should make $1,000-5,000 depending on monetization.

**Q: How long until I see traffic?**
A: 2-7 days for first organic visitors. Significant traffic at 3-6 months.

**Q: Do I need to do anything after deploying?**
A: Just monitor analytics. The site will auto-update content with ISR.

**Q: Can I add more professions?**
A: Yes! Update `prisma/seed.ts`, re-run `npx prisma db seed`, done.

**Q: Can I customize the design?**
A: Yes! Everything is in Tailwind CSS. Modify `app/` files.

**Q: What if I want to use a different domain?**
A: Update domain in `app/sitemap.ts`. That's it.
